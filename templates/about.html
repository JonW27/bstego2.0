            <b>Components</b><br>
            <small>Built with web.py (by the brilliant Aaron Swartz), mailgun, mailboxlayer, orchestrate.io (remote db), and the stegano module.</small>

            <b>Steganography Processing</b><br>
            <small>There are two main methods:</small>
        </p>    
            <ol>
                <li>lsb</li>
                <li>exifHeader</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            <small>
            LSB stands for least significant bit and basically finds the one with the lowest binary value in the byte (8 bits) and changes it. This hardly effects the image due to its low significance.
            <br>
            exifHeader works by modifying the image's headers. Each filetype has its own set of metadata carried along with it. If you open up a hex editor you'll notice that files of the same filetype share the first couple of characters. exifHeader modifies this metadata.

            <b>Why you can't pick your own password</b><br>
            <small>Any password that you can memorize or remember is NOT safe. To ensure true strong password entropy it needs to be completely random. You can only remember so many passwords, and that's when you start reusing them. This leads to huge huge password leaks. To prevent that, and not toll your memory, your password gets autogenerated and emailed to you. If someone already has control of your email they already have control of your whole life as argued in this <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/360-million-reasons-to-destroy-all-passwords-9a100b2b5001?gi=f3179c5a90dd">article</a>.
            As I was low on time, I created a quick autogeneration script that, as you can see from Steve Gibson's entropy checker, is impossible to be cracked via brute force.

                You can always check your email if you forget your password.
